This is based on vbh project: https://github.com/intel/vbh

How to compiling:
#make
Note: tested against 5.4.x kernel. For some later version, there may have compiling issue.

How to use:
1. after make, you will get a kernel module called vmx-switch.ko, and you can insmod this kernel module directly by #insmod ./vmx-switch.ko
Note: before insmode, please make sure there is no VM is running on your system.
